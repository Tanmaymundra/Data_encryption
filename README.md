Examples of Data encryption &amp; Network Security

This repository contains various example of Data Encryption Techniques used for Network Security.

Cryptography involves communication between two users through coded message. Cryptography is an art and science of concealing the information to introduce privacy and secrecy between the intended users.  The three basic goals of security are Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
Cryptography involves three basic mechanisms: Symmetric-Key (Private-Key) Encipherment, Asymmetric-Key Encipherment(Public-Key) and Hashing.
In symmetric key encipherment, a single secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. In addition, the encryption and decryption algorithms are inverses of each other. The original message known as plain text is encrypted using a secret key to obtain the unintelligible message called cipher text. This cipher text is transmitted through the channel to the intended receiver. At the receiver, the cipher text is decrypted using the same secret key to obtain the original plain text. 
Traditional Symmetric Ciphers are the foundation to modern ciphers. Traditional Symmetric Ciphers are classified into two broad categories, namely, Substitution Cipher and Transposition Cipher.
A substitution cipher replaces one symbol with another. A transposition cipher does not substitute one symbol for another, instead it changes(transposes) the location of the symbols.
